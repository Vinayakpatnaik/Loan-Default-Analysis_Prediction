# Loan-Default-Analysis_Prediction

## Aim:- 
This project aimed to develop a toolset for predicting loan default using both machine learning algorithms and data visualization tools, specifically Power BI. The combination of these will provide a better/proactive solution for financial institutions, enhancing decision-making processes and risk management.

## Dataset:- This file contains various features such as age, income, credit score, etc. for an individual and tells whether he/she has defaulted on the loan payment.
1. LoanID:- A unique identifier for each loan
2. Age:- The age of the borrower
3. Income:- The annual income of the borrower
4. LoanAmount:- The amount of money being borrowed
5. CreditScore:- The credit score of the borrower
6. MonthsEmployed:- The number of months the borrower has been employed
7. NumCreditLines:- The number of credit lines the borrower has open
8. InterestRate:- The interest rate for the loan
9. LoanTerm:- The term length of the loan in months
10. DTIRatio:- The Debt-to-Income ratio
11. Education:- The highest level of education attained by the borrower
12. EmploymentType:- The type of employment status of the borrower
13. MaritalStatus:- The marital status of the borrower
14. HasMortgage:- Whether the borrower has a mortgage
15. HasDependents:- Whether the borrower has dependents
16. LoanPurpose:- The purpose of the loan
17. HasCoSigner:- Whether the loan has a co-signer
18. Default:- Indicate whether the loan defaulted or not (target_variable)

## Methodology:
1. Data Extraction & Cleaning: Extract, transform, and load (ETL) relevant data into both Power BI for visualization and Python for preprocessing, and then into the machine learning model.
2. Machine Learning Models: Implement predictive models using algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods to forecast loan default probabilities.
3. Dashboard Design: To identify key metrics/indicators and design visually compelling dashboards for analysis.

## Expected Outcomes:
1. Accurate Predictions: Machine learning models providing accurate predictions of loan default probabilities.
2. Visual Insights: Interactive dashboards giving meaningful visual insights into the risk profile of the loan portfolio.
3. Enhanced Decision-Making: Empowering financial institutions with tools to make informed decisions and proactively manage loan default risks.

## Tools and Technologies:
1. Data cleaning: Libraries in Python like Pandas and NumPy will be useful in cleaning the data.
2. Machine Learning: Python with scikit-learn for machine learning model development.
3. Data Visualization: Power BI for creating interactive and insightful dashboards.
